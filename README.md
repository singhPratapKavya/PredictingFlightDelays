#INTRODUCTION
Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience for travelers, costing them time and money. Understanding the factors that contribute to flight delays can help airlines and airports better plan for and mitigate them. In this study, we aim to use machine learning and neural networks to predict flight delays. We will be using historical flight data, such as departure and arrival times, airline, and weather conditions, to train a model that can predict the likelihood of a delay for a given flight. Neural networks are a subset of machine learning and are known for their ability to learn complex and non-linear relationships in large datasets. By using neural networks in our analysis, we hope to achieve a more accurate prediction of flight delays. This information can be used to provide better information to travelers and help airlines improve their operations, ultimately reducing the impact of delays on passengers.
